This folder contains code for the Monte Carlo pricing of derivatives, following Mark Joshi's book on C++ design patterns in finance. Almost all the code is adapted or only slightly modified from code presented in the book, and annotated with comments for my own understanding.

Some code reimplemented in Rust also for my own learning.
